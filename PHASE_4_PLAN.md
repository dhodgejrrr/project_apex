# Phase 4 Implementation Plan: Shared State Management & Advanced Coordination

## Overview

Phase 4 introduces shared state management, workflow orchestration, and advanced coordination patterns to Project Apex. This phase builds on the Tool Registry foundation to enable agents to share data, coordinate complex workflows, and make collaborative decisions.

## Phase 4 Components

### 4.1 State Manager Service
- Centralized state store for cross-agent data sharing
- Event-driven state synchronization
- Version control and conflict resolution
- Real-time state change notifications

### 4.2 Workflow Orchestrator
- Complex multi-agent workflow definition and execution
- Task delegation and dependency management
- Parallel execution coordination
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms

### 4.3 Agent Memory System
- Persistent agent memory for learning and adaptation
- Shared knowledge base across agents
- Context preservation across workflow executions
- Performance history tracking

### 4.4 Coordination Patterns
- Master-slave coordination
- Peer-to-peer collaboration
- Hierarchical task delegation
- Consensus-based decision making

## Implementation Strategy

1. Create State Manager service with Redis/memory backend
2. Implement Workflow Orchestrator with DAG execution
3. Add agent memory capabilities with persistence
4. Enhance agents with coordination pattern support
5. Create test workflows demonstrating advanced coordination
