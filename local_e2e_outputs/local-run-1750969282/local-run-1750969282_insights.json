      "detailed_analysis": "The average pit stationary time of 6 minutes, 30.181 seconds for Car #10 (Audi) is an extreme outlier, far exceeding typical pit stop durations (which are usually under 2 minutes). This suggests a severe incident occurred during one or more pit stops, such as significant mechanical repairs, collision damage repair, or serving a major penalty (e.g., stop-and-go). Such a prolonged stop would have cost the team multiple laps, effectively ending any competitive aspirations for that race. The strategic implication is a complete loss of track position and potential points. Without addressing the root cause, this remains a critical vulnerability for Rockwell Autosport Development.",

However, this potential was undermined by an alarming race pace consistency standard deviation of 11.544 seconds and very high tire degradation, losing 2.201 seconds per lap by the end of stints. This combination points to either an overly aggressive car setup that overstresses the tires, or inconsistent driver performance/tire management. The driver delta data shows that while Jenson Altzman was slightly faster on average, the overall delta between Jenson Altzman and Chad McCumbee was only 0.014 seconds, suggesting that driver differences might not be the primary cause of the overall 11.544s consistency issue, but rather inconsistency within each driver's stint or specific setup choices impacting both. The strategic implication is that the car is fast over a single lap or early in a stint, but cannot sustain competitive performance, leading to significant time loss over a race distance.",

      "detailed_analysis": "The observed negative tire degradation rate of -0.325 seconds per lap for Car #16 (Porsche) is highly unconventional and merits deep investigation. Typically, tires degrade over a stint, leading to slower lap times. This anomaly could indicate several possibilities: 1. Data Modeling Error: The degradation model might be misinterpreting certain data points, or there could be an underlying issue with the data collection itself. 2. Unique Car Characteristic: The car might have an extremely slow tire warm-up characteristic, meaning tires only reach optimal performance late in a stint. 3. Exceptional Fuel Burn Effect: The reduction in fuel load over a stint might be so significant that it outweighs the normal tire degradation, making the car lighter and faster, thus masking actual tire wear. 4. Unconventional Setup/Strategy: The team might be running a highly aggressive setup that only comes alive later in a stint, or they have a unique tire management strategy that allows them to 'turn on' the tires late. If legitimate, this represents a significant competitive advantage, allowing Car #16 to push harder and maintain or gain pace relative to competitors towards the end of stints. Their average green pace of 2:01.439 and consistency of 2.011s stdev are respectable, making this degradation anomaly even more intriguing for CSM.",
