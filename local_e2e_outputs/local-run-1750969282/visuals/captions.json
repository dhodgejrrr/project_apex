{"pit_stationary_times.png": "Caption:\nThis chart visualizes pit stationary times, highlighting Car #10's catastrophic 6:30 stop and Car #12's highly efficient 1:31 stop.\n\nSummary:\nCar #10 (Audi) experienced a catastrophic 6:30 pit stop, completely derailing its race, highlighting a major operational failure. In contrast, Car #12 (Toyota) served as a benchmark with optimal race pace, consistency, and efficient 1:31 pit stops, showcasing near-ideal performance. Meanwhile, Car #13 (Ford) struggled with consistency despite its speed, and Car #16 (Porsche) exhibited an unusual negative tire degradation, suggesting it paradoxically gained pace late in stints.", "driver_consistency.png": "**Summary:**\nThe race analysis revealed significant performance disparities, including a catastrophic 6.5-minute pit stop for Car #10 and Car #13's high raw pace undermined by severe inconsistency and tire degradation. Conversely, Car #12 served as a benchmark with optimal pace, exceptional consistency, and minimal tire wear. Car #16 presented a unique anomaly with paradoxical negative tire degradation, indicating they became faster towards stint ends, warranting further investigation.\n\n**Caption:**\nThis chart visualizes each car's race pace consistency, showing the wide range from highly consistent to severely inconsistent performance.", "stint_pace_car_10.png": "Summary:\nThe race analysis revealed highly varied team performances, including Car #10's catastrophic 6.5-minute pit stop and Car #13's fast but inconsistent pace with high tire degradation. In contrast, Car #12 served as a benchmark with optimal pace, exceptional consistency, and minimal tire wear. Intriguingly, Car #16 exhibited a unique negative tire degradation, suggesting it improved performance later in stints.\n\nCaption:\nThis chart for Car #10 vividly displays how an anomalous 6.5-minute pit stop severely compromised its race performance and stint pace."}
