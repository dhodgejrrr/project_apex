{"pit_stationary_times.png": "Summary:\nSeveral cars displayed unique performance profiles, including Car #13's leading raw pace being unsustainable due to severe tire degradation and extreme inconsistency, and Car #10's race-losing 6.5-minute pit stop. Conversely, Car #16 exhibited an anomalous negative tire degradation, gaining pace on older tires, a rare characteristic demanding further analysis. Car #12 served as a benchmark, demonstrating strong overall pace through optimized sector times across the track.\n\nCaption:\nThis chart highlights Car #10's race-losing 6.5-minute pit stop, an extreme outlier suggesting a major incident or repair.", "driver_consistency.png": "Caption:\nThis chart illustrates Car #13's extreme race pace inconsistency, attributing it to car/tire dynamics rather than driver performance differences.\n\nSummary:\nCar #13 exhibited leading raw pace but was severely hampered by extreme race pace inconsistency and unsustainable tire degradation. Crucially, analysis determined this inconsistency stemmed from car setup/tire interaction, not significant differences between its drivers. Other key insights include Car #10's critical pit stop anomaly, Car #16's unusual negative tire degradation, and Car #12's benchmark performance.", "stint_pace_car_10.png": "**Summary:**\nCar #13 demonstrated leading raw pace but suffered severe tire degradation and extreme inconsistency, pointing to an overly aggressive setup. Car #16 exhibited an unusual negative tire degradation, becoming faster on older tires, warranting investigation into this unique characteristic. Critically, Car #10's race was lost due to an exceptionally long 6.5-minute pit stop, likely caused by a major incident.\n\n**Caption:**\nThis chart illustrates Car #10's race stint, prominently featuring the 6.5-minute pit stop anomaly that severely impacted its race."}
