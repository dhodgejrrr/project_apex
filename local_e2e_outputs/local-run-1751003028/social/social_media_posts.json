We are a professional racing team, and our social media must reflect our expertise, strategic thinking, and dedication to excellence, not just report facts or competitors' failures.

This is a fundamental failure that undermines credibility and wastes a prime opportunity to engage with data.", "Suboptimal Visual Strategy: Post 4, discussing another team's struggles, lacks any visual data to support the claim, making it seem less analytical and more like casual commentary. If 'Our analysis shows,' then show the analysis.", "Brand Focus and Tone: While analyzing competitors is acceptable, some posts (especially Post 4) focus too much on other teams' failures without a clear strategic tie-in to *our* team's performance, learning, or advantage. Post 1, while good, could also be framed more from *our* team's perspective.", "Limited Actionable Insights: Several posts, particularly Post 4, offer very little in terms of deep, actionable insights for knowledgeable racing fans beyond surface-level observations or generic questions.
