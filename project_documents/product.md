## **Product Strategy: Project Apex - The AI Race Strategist**

### **1. Vision Statement**

To create an autonomous, multi-agent system that transforms raw race data into a decisive competitive advantage. Project Apex will serve as an AI Race Strategist, providing real-time insights, predictive analysis, and automated content generation to empower our engineers on the pit wall and our marketing team in the digital paddock.

### **2. The Problem We're Solving**

Race weekends are a high-pressure environment defined by an overwhelming firehose of data and a severe lack of time. Race teams constantly struggle with:

*   **Information Overload:** Manually sifting through timing sheets, sector data, and pit logs to find meaningful patterns is slow and prone to error.
*   **Time-Critical Decisions:** Strategic decisions (when to pit, who to put in the car, tire strategy) must be made in seconds, often with incomplete information.
*   **Complex Comparisons:** Evaluating performance against competitors or historical data (e.g., last year's race) is a cumbersome, multi-step process.
*   **Marketing Content Lag:** Generating engaging, data-driven social media content during a live race weekend is a low priority for the engineering team, resulting in missed marketing opportunities.

### **3. Our Solution: A Multi-Agent System with ADK**

Project Apex leverages the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) to orchestrate a team of specialized AI agents. Each agent has a distinct role, and they collaborate to automate the entire data-to-insight-to-action workflow. This system directly uses your `imsa_analyzer.py` as its core analytical engine.

#### **Hackathon Category Alignment:**

This project is a perfect fit for multiple hackathon categories:

*   **Primary: Data Analysis and Insights:** At its core, Project Apex is about autonomously analyzing complex time-series data (race telemetry) from various sources (CSV, JSON) and deriving meaningful, actionable insights. We can leverage **BigQuery** to store historical race data for powerful year-over-year comparisons.
*   **Secondary: Automation of Complex Processes:** The system automates the intricate workflow of data ingestion, analysis, anomaly detection, report generation, and content creation â€“ a process that is currently manual and time-consuming.
*   **Secondary: Content Creation and Generation:** A dedicated agent will autonomously generate marketing copy and suggest visuals, directly addressing a key business need.

### **4. The Multi-Agent Architecture**

We will design and orchestrate the following agents using Google's ADK:

**1. The `DataIngestor` Agent:**
*   **Task:** Monitors a specified location (e.g., a Google Cloud Storage bucket) for new timing & scoring CSVs and pit data JSONs.
*   **Function:** Upon detecting new files for a session (Practice, Qualifying, Race), it validates them and triggers the analysis workflow.

**2. The `CoreAnalyzer` Agent (Your Python script's new home):**
*   **Task:** To execute the race data analysis.
*   **Function:** Receives file paths from the `DataIngestor`. It runs the `IMSADataAnalyzer` class, performing all the calculations (fastest laps, stints, degradation, etc.) and outputs the comprehensive `_enhanced.json` results file.

**3. The `InsightHunter` Agent:**
*   **Task:** To find the "so what?" in the data. This is the key intelligence layer.
*   **Function:** Reads the JSON output from the `CoreAnalyzer`. It's programmed with heuristics to identify critical insights and anomalies, such as:
    *   **Performance Alerts:** "Car #14's pit stop #3 was 12 seconds slower than their average."
    *   **Pace Analysis:** "Driver Jenson Altzman on car #13 is consistently 0.5s faster per lap than his teammate on old tires."
    *   **Degradation Flag:** "The tire degradation model for the #95 BMW shows a steep drop-off after lap 20, faster than the competing Mercedes-AMGs."
    *   **Opportunity Identification:** "The #57 Winward car has the longest green flag stint capability. Our fuel window can be stretched to match."

**4. The `Historian` Agent:**
*   **Task:** To provide year-over-year context and BoP (Balance of Performance) analysis.
*   **Function:** Connects to **Google BigQuery**, where all past race analysis JSONs are stored. When triggered, it compares the current race results against historical data for the same track. It answers questions like:
    *   "How much faster is the overall field compared to last year?"
    *   "Has the BoP change affected the top speed of the new Ford Mustang relative to the Porsche?"
    *   "Is our tire degradation better or worse on this year's compound compared to last year?"

**5. The `Visualizer` Agent:**
*   **Task:** To create compelling charts and graphs from the data.
*   **Function:** Takes structured data from the `InsightHunter` or `Historian` and generates visual artifacts using libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly. Examples:
    *   A line chart plotting the tire degradation curves for our car vs. a key competitor.
    *   A bar chart showing the average stationary pit times for all teams in our class.
    *   A lap-by-lap pace comparison chart between our two drivers.

**6. The `Scribe` Agent (Report Generator):**
*   **Task:** To create concise, human-readable reports for the engineering team.
*   **Function:** Collates the key findings from the `InsightHunter` and `Historian`, along with relevant charts from the `Visualizer`, and compiles them into a clean PDF or a dashboard view for the pit wall.

**7. The `Publicist` Agent (Social Media Bot):**
*   **Task:** To generate engaging social media content.
*   **Function:** Takes a specific, pre-approved insight (e.g., "We had the fastest pit stop of the race") and crafts a post.
    *   **Example Tweet:** "What a stop! ðŸš€ The crew for the #OUR_CAR_NUMBER machine just nailed the fastest pit stop in the GS class. That's how you gain track position! #IMSA #MichelinPilotChallenge @IMSA @MichelinRaceUSA"
    *   **Example Post Idea:** "Data Deep DiveðŸ“ˆ: Our AI Race Strategist shows driver [Driver Name] is a master of tire management. Check out this degradation curve compared to the field average. #RaceTech #DataScience #Motorsport"
    *   It can even tag the relevant driver, manufacturer, and series handles.

### **5. Workflow Orchestration**

A race engineer can initiate the workflow with a simple prompt: **"Analyze the latest qualifying session and compare to last year's pole lap."**

1.  **Orchestrator** (the main ADK script) starts the process.
2.  `DataIngestor` finds the new qualifying CSV.
3.  `CoreAnalyzer` runs the analysis, producing `qualifying_results.json`.
4.  **Orchestrator** tasks two agents in parallel:
    *   `InsightHunter` scans the JSON for qualifying performance anomalies.
    *   `Historian` pulls last year's qualifying JSON from BigQuery and compares key metrics (pole time, sector times, speed traps).
5.  Findings are sent to the `Visualizer` to create a "Pole Lap Delta" chart (showing time gained/lost in each sector vs. last year) and the `Scribe` to generate a pre-race strategy report.
6.  Simultaneously, the `Publicist` drafts a tweet: "Pole Position! A stunning 1:XX.XXX lap from @OurDriver puts us on P1 for tomorrow's race at @Mid_Ohio! The team gave him a rocketship. ðŸš€ #IMSA"
7.  All generated artifacts (PDF report, charts, draft tweet) are presented to the engineer for final review and action.

### **6. Competitive Advantage & Use on Race Weekend**

Project Apex is not just a hackathon project; it's a mission-critical tool:

*   **Pre-Race Strategy:** Understand competitor weaknesses and historical trends to build a better starting strategy.
*   **Live Race Insights:** Get real-time alerts on pit stop performance, driver pace drop-off, or unexpected strategies from rivals.
*   **Driver Coaching:** Use visual data to show drivers exactly where they are losing or gaining time compared to teammates or rivals.
*   **Post-Race Debrief:** Automate the creation of detailed post-race analysis reports, freeing up engineering time.

### **7. Hackathon Deliverables**

1.  **GitHub Repository:** Containing the full ADK project, your `imsa_analyzer.py` module, and deployment instructions.
2.  **Demo Video (3-5 minutes):** A slick video showing the "prompt-to-insight" workflow. Start with the raw data, show the agents collaborating (can be visualized with logs or a simple UI), and end with the final outputs: the engineering report, a stunning graph, and a ready-to-post tweet.
3.  **Presentation Slides:** A clear deck explaining the problem, the multi-agent architecture, the workflow, and the competitive/business value.

This strategy positions your project as a sophisticated, practical, and innovative solution that perfectly aligns with the hackathon's goals while providing immense real-world value to your race team. Good luck
